# Biomedical-Engineering-Project
This project was created within the framework of biomedical engineering subject.
In the first part of the project, 8 EEG records are given. I was asked to identify spikes and find an empirical rule for the threshold.
In the second part, I apply my empirical rule in order to find spikes in 4  EEG records (testing data).
Actually, data given is actually the activity of three separate neurons, where each of them produces spikes with unique charachteristics.
Lastly, I perform a clustering routine to the spikes I found, so as to identify those three separate neurons.

Unfortunately, the whole question of the project is in greek.
